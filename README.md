# Tooling!

I have created this repo to make my tooling setup files more portable.
bash_aliases and phpstorm to be more precise.

My goal is to add a VScode config file as well with matching shortcuts as phpstorm to allow consistant use across both platforms. Laracasts/mastering phpstorm was the inspiration for almost all of the phpstorm shortcuts. I have included what the default keybinding is along with what I have remapped it to.
